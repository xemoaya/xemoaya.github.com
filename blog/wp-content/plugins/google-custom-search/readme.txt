This plugin uses Google's Search Engine to search your site's contents!
You can also configure it through google to search multiple sites/domains.

== Description ==


This plugin uses the power of Google to search the contents on your wordpress site.

Wordpress has a relatively good search functionality but tends to get sluggish and doesn't match keywords that well.
This is even more apparent when your site is quite large and you have many posts and/or pages.
In addition, wordpress search functionality display results ordered by date and not by its relevance to the keywords.

Google Custom Search Engine is not limited to just your site. You can configure it through google to search multiple sites/domains.

Or how about having a search Engine which searches all websites within your blog's niche?


Combining the power of Google's search engine along with the familiarity of their interface, this is a must have plugin for all websites.


The plugin is very **flexible** and you can configure both the search box and the search results.

Google Custom Search widget's search box can be displayed as either a widget or placed anywhere in the code (php and wordpress theme familiarity required to do this).

The search results can be displayed in one of three formats:

1. As a pop-up resizable dialog.
2. Within the widget, under the search box.
3. Displayed anywhere in the code (php and wordpress theme familiarity required to do this).


To display the search-box anywhere in the code, the following method should be used

`<?php display_search_box($display_results_option); ?>`

where $display_results_option is one of the following three options:

* **DISPLAY_RESULTS_AS_POP_UP**           - display the search results as a pop-up resizeable dialog
* **DISPLAY_RESULTS_IN_UNDER_SEARCH_BOX** - display the search results under the search box
* **DISPLAY_RESULTS_CUSTOM**		- display the search results in the place you have specified.

e.g: `<?php display_search_box(DISPLAY_RESULTS_AS_POP_UP); ?>`


To specify a location where the search result is to be displayed, the following method should be used.

`<?php display_gsc_results(); ?>`
